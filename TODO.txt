TODO:

Re-write ABOUT content. Most of what is there atm is just temporary.
	Add keywords/language employers would want to see.
	Add actual photo of myself.
	Find a way to make about section more interesting, black text on the dark blue doesn't really work.

Better card styling; no idea what to do with white space on front and back of cards.
	Limit card rows to two so that they all fit on one screen?
		Figure out alternative for mobile.

Own backend for contact form; currently using formspree
	include email on side of contact me (example: https://codepen.io/daniloaquino/full/bqqKPZ/)
