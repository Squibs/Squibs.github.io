<em>Completed May 23, 2017</em>

Created for the second basic front end development project from freeCodeCamp. I created a portfolio for myself to feature projects and let people know a little about myself. It includes a contact form which can send an email to me directly from the web page itself using formspree. There are many improvements I can still yet make, and those will come later once I learn more.
